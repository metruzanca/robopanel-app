I've made snippets to help with making boilerplates. (This assumes you're using vscode)

| Short Cut    | Description                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stackpage`  | Creates a Stack page. Less likely to use this one                                       |
| `drawerpage` | Creates a Drawer page. This makes up the majority of the app. Also not done made yet... |
